    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 ounce active dry yeast* (1 packet)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (you may need as much as 4 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Let's get started</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the warm water and sugar in a large bowl and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set 
            aside for 5 minutes to allow the yeast to proof.</li>  
        <li>Add the butter and 2 cups of the flour, and beat on medium speed for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in an additional 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 cups of flour, along with the salt, mixing until 
            the dough gathers itself into a ball and pulls away cleanly from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Continue to knead, adding an additional 1/2 to 3/4 cup flour, until the dough is smooth and 
            elastic (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a large greased bowl, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Allow it to rise 
            in a warm place until doubled in size (30 to 45 minutes).</li>
        <li>Lightly mist a 5 cup loaf pan with non-stick spray.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in the prepared pan, cover it loosely with greased plastic wrap, and allow it to 
            rise in a warm place until doubled in size (30 to 45 minutes).</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Uncover the dough and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the loaf sounds hollow when lightly tapped.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
    <p>*Instant yeast may be substituted.  Rise time may need to be reduced by 10 to 15 minutes.  You'll know your dough 
        is done rising when it has doubled in volume.</p>
